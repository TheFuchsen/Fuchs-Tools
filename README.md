# FuchsTools

## One Click Material

## Material Set

## Shader Helper

## Place 2d Merger

## Refresh UV Tiles and Remove Unused Shading Nodes

These are just shortcuts for already available tools in maya, but that are usually in a very inconvenient place.

## Color Space Shortcuts

## Make Me Random

## FBX node patcher

## Unpaste

## Select Hard Edges

Very handy tool to select hard edges.

## Tesselation Switch

Batch modify Tesselation settings for multiple objects. TBH I made this before I was aware the Object Mesh Parameters existed, so use that instead, it is better in every way.

## Quick Toggles

### Wireframe

### Primary Visibility

This can also be done better with Mesh Parameters but I've gotten used to this.

### Filter Mesh

### Auto Sweep

### Toggle Hair

### Dup Detector

## Alembic Tools

### Alembic Shortcuts

### Alembic Blendshapes

## Animation Helpers

### Toggle Evaluation

Little script that allows to change the playback step from 1.0 to 0.5 (Will add 0.25 in the future). Very handy for limited subframe exports (Like alembic)
